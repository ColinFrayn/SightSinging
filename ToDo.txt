ToDo for SightSinging App
-------------------------

: Misc
- Make sure last note gets de-highlighted (and stops sounding) when it has stopped playing
- Add double sharps/flats for highest difficulty levels
- Maybe sometimes prefer sharp instead of natural e.g. for B# instead of C-natural if key is e.g. F#maj
- Replace notes with pictures instead of graphics
- Button to play root chord / scale for cue?
- User can adjust the number of notes
